      summary: "&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#8242;t really tell about Mama&amp;#8242;s brain just from looking at her&amp;#44; but it was obvious as soon as she spoke. She had a high voice&amp;#44; like a little girl&amp;#8242;s&amp;#44; and she only knew 23 words. I know this for a fact&amp;#44; because we kept a list of the things Mama said tacked to the inside of the kitchen cabinet. Most of the words were common ones&amp;#44; like good and more and hot&amp;#44; but there was one word only my mother said: soof. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although she lives an unconventional lifestyle with her mentally disabled mother and their doting neighbour&amp;#44; Bernadette&amp;#44; Heidi has a lucky streak that has a way of pointing her in the right direction. When a mysterious word in her mother&amp;#8242;s vocabulary begins to haunt her&amp;#44; Heidi&amp;#8242;s thirst for the truth leads her on a cross&amp;#45;country journey in search of the secrets of her past.&lt;/p&gt;",

      title: "A Spy Among Friends",
      author: "Ben Macintyre",
      summary: "&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Master storyteller Ben Macintyre's most ambitious work to date offers a powerful new angle on the 20th century's greatest spy story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Philby was the greatest spy in history, a brilliant and charming man who rose to head Britain's counterintelligence against the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War--while he was secretly working for the enemy. And nobody thought he knew Philby like Nicholas Elliott, Philby's best friend and fellow officer in MI6. The two men had gone to the same schools, belonged to the same exclusive clubs, grown close through the crucible of wartime intelligence work and long nights of drink and revelry. It was madness for one to think the other might be a communist spy, bent on subverting Western values and the power of the free world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Philby was secretly betraying his friend.
