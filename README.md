# opds-browser
JavaScript OPDS feed browser

## Standalone App
OPDS Browser can be run as a standalone app mounted in a DOM element:

```javascript
new OPDSBrowserApp(config, elementId);
```

For an example of OPDS Browser in use as a standalone app, see the [demo server template](packages/server/views/index.html.ejs) included in this repository .

### Standalone Config Options

- `pathFor(collectionUrl: string, bookUrl: string) => string`: required function that accepts a collection URL and book URL and returns a string that will become the web browser's relative URL upon navigating to a new collection or book
- `pathPattern`: a react-router [RoutePattern](reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/Glossary.md#routepattern) representing how to map a web browser URL to a collectionUrl and bookUrl. Default: `/(collection/:collectionUrl/)(book/:bookUrl/)`
- `collectionUrl`: optional initial URL of an OPDS feed to load. Default: `null` (allow user to enter URL)
- `bookUrl`: optional initial URL of an OPDS Entry to load. Default: `null`
- `proxyUrl`: optional local proxy path to which all remote URLs will be posted. Default: `undefined`
- `pageTitleTemplate(collectionTitle: string, bookTitle: string) => string`: optional function that accepts a collection and book title and returns an HTML page title. Default: `undefined`

## React Component
OPDSBrowser is also available as a reusable React component:

```jsx
import OPDSBrowser from "opds-browser";

ReactDOM.render(
  <OPDSBrowser
    collectionUrl={this.props.collectionUrl}
    bookUrl={this.props.bookUrl}
    isTopLevel={this.props.isTopLevel}
    pageTitleTemplate={this.pageTitleTemplate}
    BookDetailsContainer={BookDetailsContainer}
    Header={Header}
    />
);
```

For an example of OPDS Browser in use as a React component, see [NYPL-Simplified/circulation-web].

### React Component Props

- `collectionUrl`: optional URL of an OPDS Acquisition or Navigation feed to load. Default: `null`
- `bookUrl`: optional URL of an OPDS Entry to load. Default: `null`
- `isTopLevel`: optional boolean, if `true` and accompanying a `collectionUrl`, then in the breadcrumbs section of the browser the provided collection will be displayed immediately after the catalog root. If `false`, the provided collection will generally be added to the end of the existing breadcrumbs. Default: `false`
- `pageTitleTemplate(collectionTitle: string, bookTitle: string) => string`: optional function that accepts a collection and book title and returns an HTML page title. Default: `undefined`
- `Header`: optional custom React component class to render in place of OPDS Browser's default header. This `Header` will receive one prop, `BrowserLink` which should be used for links to collections or books that OPDS Browser should load, and one child, a `Search` component that will only be present when the loaded collection links to an Open Search Description document. Default: `undefined`
- `BookDetailsContainer`: optional custom React component class to render in place of OPDS Browser's default `BookDetails` component. This `BookDetailsContainer` will receive three props: the current `collectionUrl` and `bookUrl`, and `refreshBrowser`, a function that can be called to refresh the collection and/or book. `BookDetailsContainer` will also receive the default rendered `BookDetails` component as a child. Default: `undefined`

### React Component Context

The OPDSBrowser React component should be rendered within a [React context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) that includes two items:

- `router`: any object that implements the `push`, `createHref`, and `isActive` methods of react-router's [context.router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#contextrouter)
- `pathFor(collectionUrl: string, bookUrl: string) => string`: a function that accepts a collection URL and book URL and returns a string that will become the web browser's relative URL upon navigating to a new collection or book
